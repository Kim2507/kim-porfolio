 * My name is Kim Trinh, and I was born in Vietnam. I was obsessed with Lego when I was a kid. I have always been curious about how technology works behind the scenes, such as smartphones and computers. However, Vietnam has limited resources, and I couldn't delve deeply into it.

Luckily, I had the opportunity to move to the USA, and that was when I decided to pursue my dream. I started taking courses at a community college, and I fell in love with programming and coding. I am now a STEM student interested in Computer Science and Technology, continuing to pursue my education towards my dream career.

I enjoy solving problems and thinking critically because we can always find better solutions and make informed decisions in various aspects of life(computer science course and programming teachs me all these). I appreciate the process of building a software application, taking small steps, and seeing things work as I expect them to.

I am committed to continuous learning and working towards computer science projects that can have a positive impact on our community.
